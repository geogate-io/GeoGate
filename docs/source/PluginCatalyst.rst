`Catalyst <https://catalyst-in-situ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ is an API specification
developed for simulations to analyze and visualize data in situ. The generic Catalyst plugin is 
designed to provide in situ data visualization and processing capability to the fully coupled Earth 
system modeling applications or individual model components that use `ESMF (Earth System Modeling Framework) 
<https://earthsystemmodeling.org/doc/>_` and `NUOPC (National Unified Operational Prediction Capability) 
Layer <https://earthsystemmodeling.org/nuopc/>`_ layer to couple physical and data components.
